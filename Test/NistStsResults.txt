### Test results using the graphical version of NIST Statistical Test Suite (Nist STS) ###
https://github.com/Steppenwolfe65/NIST-Statistical-Test-Suite
All tests supplied with 10Mb of random integers generated by the RandomOutputTest of the CEX test suite.
Tests are 'first run results' *not* the best results of a series, (although multiple tests on each primitive has been performed to ensure continuing accuracy).
