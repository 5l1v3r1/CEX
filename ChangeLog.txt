Version 1.1f
Changes June 04, 2016:
* AES-NI added (512 key and HKDF key expansion capable).

Version 1.1g
Changes July 08, 2016:
* Blake2 added; 2B, 2BP, 2S, and 2SP, sequential and parallel, integrated Mac and Drbg, optional intrinsics.

Version 1.1g
Changes July 09, 2016:
* Added intrinsics to the parallelized ChaCha implementation
* Work on CpuDetect, (all intrinsics are now runtime enabled automatically).
* Set default SSE support to AVX /arch:AVX
* Work begun on intrinsics symmetric mode chain

Version 1.1g
Changes July 14, 2016:
* Added SIMD wrappers UInt128 and UInt256
* Added intrinsics support to Twofish and Serpent (Encrypt64 and Decrypt64)
* Added intrinsics block process (mm128 -4 block) intrinsics to parallel CTR block cipher mode
* Expanded intrinsic support in AES-NI (AHX) to 4 block (Encrypt64 and Decrypt64)
* Serpent changed from outputting big endian to little endian (breaking change)
* Added intrinsics intrgrity tests to ParallelModeTest.

Version 1.1h
Changes July 18, 2016:
* SIMD intrinsics supported added to Serpent (SHX), Twofish (THX) and extended in Rijndael (AHX)
* Block cipher CTR mode runtime switched (cpu check) to use 128 (SSE3) and 256 (AVX) intrinsics if available
* 128 and 256 SIMD support added to ChaCha and Salsa implementations
* C++ exceptions support now optional via the ENABLE_CPPEXCEPTIONS flag in Config.h
* Added various intrinsics tests to ParallelModeTest class

Version 1.1j
Changes August 12, 2016:
* Fixed bug in SIMD counter staggered offsets in Salsa and ChaCha implementations
* Fixed bug in symmetric cipher Initialize() where disabling exceptions caused digest initialization to throw
* Parallel mode and CipherStream tests extended and adjusted
